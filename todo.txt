# Todo list

## Fix address loading

- store Address and Last Address Update in Photo in the database
- implement setAddressUpdateTimestamp() and updateAddress()

## Implement photo editing and deleting

- Add a save/delete panel in the roll activity with Save and Delete buttons
- Make items in the photo list selectable (one at a time)
- When an item is selected, go to edit mode:
    - hide the snap panel and show the save/delete panel
    - load the item data into the fields
- When clicking save or delete, deselect the item and reset the fields

## Refactor the database to allow for sync

- make everything in the database use UUID's instead of IDs, so there aren't
  collisions with IDs on different devices
- add a last_change column to all items which is milliseconds since 1970-01-01 00:00 UTC
- don't actually "delete" items - instead add an "is_deleted" column, and make
  all selects match only not deleted items. when adding a new item, find an
  old deleted item and resurrect it. only add a new one if there's no old one
  available.


# Sync procedure

- step 1: perform a Get. Update all items whose received last_changed is newer
  than local. Add any items which are not locally present.
- step 2: push all items whose local last_changed is greater than the one
  received from sync

# Sync api

get an url in the form: https://foo.example.com/bla/bla/#/some_space_key

* /get:
    request:
        {
            "spaces": ["space1_key", "space2_key" ...]
        }
